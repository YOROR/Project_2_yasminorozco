# Project_2_yasminorozco
My project 2. This is the final submission for BIMM 143.


Question:Is it possible for Mice(MUS) HEXIM1 protein be used as a model comparison to study Human(Homosapien) HEXIM1 protein?

Hypothesis:If HEXIM 1 protein in Mice(MUS) is similar in sequence and function then it can be used as a comparison model to study HEXIM1 in Humans(Homosapien)? 


Here is a run down of what I have included.
